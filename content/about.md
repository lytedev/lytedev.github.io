## About Me

My name is Daniel Flanagan. I was born in Virginia (but my family didn't stay
long) and now live in Kansas City, Missouri.  My family still lives in the area
and I have 6 awesome little brothers. Yes, my parents had seven boys and are
fantastic. I'm married and have a son of my own, who is an absolute *joy*!
I love my family quite a lot.

I'm a systems engineer/software developer and an elder-in-training for my [small
church](https://kcrising.church) where I run all the tech and audio-visual
systems. My faith is the framework around which I've built my life and it plays
a pivotal role in all aspects of my life.

I'm a big proponent of self-discipline and working from home. My favorite video
game has to be *Super Smash Bros. Melee*. I listen to a lot of metal and
electronic music. My favorite drink is *Red Bull Yellow Edition* and I prefer
tea over coffee. I run GNU/Linux (Arch btw) on all my machines. My keyboard is
an ErgoDox Infinity that was a blast to put together. 

My wife, Valerie, is absolutely the most beautiful and lovely woman in the
entire world. She's a Physical Therapist Assistant by vocation and somewhat of
a fitness and health nut, which has yet to rub off on me (darn!).  Now she
raises our son Oliver and savors every second. We've been married since late
2016 and we fall more in love every day. We currently live in a cozy little
apartment which she somehow manages to keep clean, organized, and
well-decorated while managing a growing baby boy.

## How Did I Get Started?

I grew up not around the dining table, but around the keyboard or latest
Nintendo console; video games were bonding and family time. I discovered
programming through my dad who showed me `QBASIC` after I persisted in asking
how video games were made. Within a few weeks I had made a simple snake game and
he then bought me a book titled *C# for the Absolute Beginner* and that was it.
I was hooked.

I moved from C# to the web quite naturally, as the things I wanted to make were
community-oriented and I loved the idea of users or friends not needing to
install anything to use what I made. I got niche-famous in the video game
modding scene and had a handful of other neat projects. I also had a job washing
cars after I dropped out of high school (because college was expensive and time
consuming and I could already write code... or so I told myself) when
a recruiter found some of my work and landed me my first programming gig.

And now... here I am!
