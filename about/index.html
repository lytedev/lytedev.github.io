<hr />

<p>My name is Daniel Flanagan. Yes, I <strong>always</strong> dress up like that. I was born in
Virginia (but my family didn&rsquo;t stay long) and now live in Kansas City, Missouri.
My family lives here, too! I have 6 awesome little brothers. Yes, my parents had
seven boys and are fantastic. I love my family quite a lot.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a software developer and an elder-in-training for the small church I&rsquo;ve been
a part of since its conception in 2012 or so called Rising. I also run all the
tech and audio-visual systems there and I love it. My faith is the framework
around which I&rsquo;ve built my life and it has never failed me.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a big proponent of self-discipline, working from home, and working less than
40 hours per week. My favorite video games include <em>Super Smash Bros. Melee</em>,
<em>Quake 3</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em>, <em>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</em>, <em>Portal</em>,
<em>Half-Life 2</em>, and others. I listen to a lot of metal (<em>DragonForce</em>!) and
electronic music. My favorite drink is <em>Red Bull Yellow Edition</em> and I prefer
tea over coffee. I run Arch Linux on all my machines and have almost got my wife
to switch over to Ubuntu, though in fairness it&rsquo;s mostly due to her MacBook
beginning to show its age. I have an odd obsession with mechanical keyboards
(thanks, reddit).</p>

        <figcaption>My wife and I. Yes. It's true. I only have the <strong>one</strong> pose.</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>I&rsquo;m married to Valerie, the most beautiful woman in the entire world. She&rsquo;s
a trained and working Physical Therapist Assistant and somewhat of a fitness
and health nut, which has yet to rub off on me (darn!). We&rsquo;ve been married since
late 2016 and we fall more in love every day. We currently live in a cozy little
apartment which she somehow manages to keep clean, organized, and
well-decorated, between working her two jobs.</p>

<p>I could talk about her for quite a long time, but this probably isn&rsquo;t the place
to do that. We (sort of) run a blog at
<a href="https://danielandvalerie.life">danielandvalerie.life</a> and we&rsquo;ll hopefully get around
to putting her bio up on there!</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<hr />

<p>I grew up not around the dining table, but around the keyboard or latest
Nintendo console; video games were bonding and family time. I discovered
programming through my dad (whom I refer to as &ldquo;Daddy&rdquo;) who showed me QBASIC
after I persisted in asking how video games were made. Within a few weeks I had
made a simple snake game and he bought me a book title <em>C# for the Absolute
Beginner</em> and that was it. I was hooked.</p>

<p>I moved from C# to the web quite naturally, as the things I wanted to make were
community-oriented and I loved the idea of users or friends not needing to
install anything to use what I made. I had a job washing cars after I dropped
out of high school (because college was expensive and time consuming and I could
already write code&hellip; so I thought!) when a recruiter found some of my work and
landed me my first programming gig at a small web company in town that owned
some popular online services and made money via ads and was focused on M&amp;A.</p>

<p>After that company went down, I binge watched the office before I realized
I couldn&rsquo;t just laze around forever. I called my recruiter and landed another
position at <a href="https://emfluence.com">emfluence</a>, a digital marketing firm in downtown KC.
These guys were (and are!) fantastic and a part of me really misses the
environment. After a year or so of working there, I was let go as my boss sensed
a lack of drive or interest in what the company was doing.</p>

<p>After a month or so of trying to figure out what to do, my financial advisor
contacted me about possibly making some web applications for him and I realized
I could totally freelance! <a href="https://iqcalculators.com">IQ Wealth Calculators</a> was born and I was hired
to create the calculator(s) side of things.</p>

<p>Since then, I&rsquo;ve been picking up and hunting down any work I can, primarily here
in Kansas City. I have a big heart for Christian organizations and have
volunteered/donated my abilities wherever and whenever I can.</p>

<p>To this day I dream of someday making video games for a living. It&rsquo;s a shame the
game development industry is currently a bit overloaded.</p>
