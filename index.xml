      <description>Introductions My name is Daniel Flanagan. Yes, I always dress up like that. I was born in Virginia (but my family didn&amp;rsquo;t stay long) and now live in Kansas City, Missouri. My family lives here, too! I have 6 awesome little brothers. Yes, my parents had seven boys and are fantastic. I love my family quite a lot.
I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer and an elder-in-training for the small church I&amp;rsquo;ve been a part of since its conception in 2012 or so called Rising.</description>

      <description>Like millions of other websites, I use Google Analytics on lytedev.io. It records data about my visitors &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s you! It tracks what website you came form to get here, how long you stay, some information about the device you&amp;rsquo;re using to view lytedev.io, and some other information.
What do I do with this information? It helps me better understand the kind of people come to my site and what content theyâ€™re reading.</description>
