&lt;h2 id=&#34;introductions&#34;&gt;Introductions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Daniel Flanagan. Yes, I &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; dress up like that. I was born in
Virginia (but my family didn&amp;rsquo;t stay long) and now live in Kansas City, Missouri.
My family lives here, too! I have 6 awesome little brothers. Yes, my parents had
seven boys and are fantastic. I love my family quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer and an elder-in-training for the small church I&amp;rsquo;ve been
a part of since its conception in 2012 or so called Rising. I also run all the
tech and audio-visual systems there and I love it. My faith is the framework
around which I&amp;rsquo;ve built my life and it has never failed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a big proponent of self-discipline, working from home, and working less than
40 hours per week. My favorite video games include &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Melee&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Quake 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Counter Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;, and others. I listen to a lot of metal (&lt;em&gt;DragonForce&lt;/em&gt;!) and
electronic music. My favorite drink is &lt;em&gt;Red Bull Yellow Edition&lt;/em&gt; and I prefer
tea over coffee. I run Arch Linux on all my machines and have almost got my wife
to switch over to Ubuntu, though in fairness it&amp;rsquo;s mostly due to her MacBook
beginning to show its age. I have an odd obsession with mechanical keyboards
(thanks, reddit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;text-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;figure&gt;
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://lytedev.io/img/daniel-and-valerie.jpg&#34; class=&#34;avatar&#34; alt=&#34;Daniel and his wife in a forest.&#34; title=&#34;Daniel and Valerie&#34;&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;My wife and I. Yes. It&#39;s true. I only have the &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; pose.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m married to Valerie, the most beautiful woman in the entire world. She&amp;rsquo;s
a trained and working Physical Therapist Assistant and somewhat of a fitness
and health nut, which has yet to rub off on me (darn!). We&amp;rsquo;ve been married since
late 2016 and we fall more in love every day. We currently live in a cozy little
apartment which she somehow manages to keep clean, organized, and
well-decorated, between working her two jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I could talk about her for quite a long time, but this probably isn&amp;rsquo;t the place
to do that. We (sort of) run a blog at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://danielandvalerie.life&#34;&gt;danielandvalerie.life&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully get around
to putting her bio up on there!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up not around the dining table, but around the keyboard or latest
Nintendo console; video games were bonding and family time. I discovered
programming through my dad (whom I refer to as &amp;ldquo;Daddy&amp;rdquo;) who showed me QBASIC
after I persisted in asking how video games were made. Within a few weeks I had
made a simple snake game and he bought me a book title &lt;em&gt;C# for the Absolute
Beginner&lt;/em&gt; and that was it. I was hooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved from C# to the web quite naturally, as the things I wanted to make were
community-oriented and I loved the idea of users or friends not needing to
install anything to use what I made. I had a job washing cars after I dropped
out of high school (because college was expensive and time consuming and I could
already write code&amp;hellip; so I thought!) when a recruiter found some of my work and
landed me my first programming gig at a small web company in town that owned
some popular online services and made money via ads and was focused on M&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that company went down, I binge watched the office before I realized
I couldn&amp;rsquo;t just laze around forever. I called my recruiter and landed another
position at &lt;a href=&#34;https://emfluence.com&#34;&gt;emfluence&lt;/a&gt;, a digital marketing firm in downtown KC.
These guys were (and are!) fantastic and a part of me really misses the
environment. After a year or so of working there, I was let go as my boss sensed
a lack of drive or interest in what the company was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a month or so of trying to figure out what to do, my financial advisor
contacted me about possibly making some web applications for him and I realized
I could totally freelance! &lt;a href=&#34;https://iqcalculators.com&#34;&gt;IQ Wealth Calculators&lt;/a&gt; was born and I was hired
to create the calculator(s) side of things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been picking up and hunting down any work I can, primarily here
in Kansas City. I have a big heart for Christian organizations and have
volunteered/donated my abilities wherever and whenever I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this day I dream of someday making video games for a living. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame the
game development industry is currently a bit overloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
